Welcome to the JESPR quick start guide and archive.
JESPR is primarily a JavaScript library and associated
tools to help set up and run self-paced reading task
experiments within a web browers. In order to quickly
set up and run a sample JESPR experiment, follow the
instructions below.

1. Unzip the archive into a folder, say "jespr".

2. Open the file "index.html" in a web browser (e.g.,
Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari).

3. Click the button to begin a demo experiment.

4. Afterward, edit the experiment definition file
(jespr-experiment.js) as desired to set up your own
experiment.

5. Deploy the experiment to your target participants:
   - Have them take the experiment on your computer
   - Move the folder to a web server and invite
     participants to take the experiment from anywhere
   - Embed relevant code in a crowd-sourcing service
     like Amazon Mechanical Turk and manage the experi-
     ment on that platform.

See the JESPR Wiki for detailed information about
experiment set up and deployment options.
