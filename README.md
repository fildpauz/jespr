# JESPR
A javascript library for conducting browser-based self-paced reading experiments.

## Overview

JESPR is a javascript library that is designed to help language researchers to conduct self-paced reading experiments (i.e., as described in Just, Carpenter, and Woolley 1982 [[1][]]) through a browser interface. JESPR is compatible with all modern browsers that can process javascript and can be set up to run on a local machine, or remotely, enabling the possibility of gathering data through crowd-sourcing services. The experimental procedure and interface is highly customizable and data output can be easily imported into analysis applications such as Excel or R. Development is ongoing, and future plans include adding capability for touch-enabled and small form-factor screens.

The quickest way to find out how JESPR works is to try the [JESPR Demo](https://fildpauz.github.io/jespr/). For those seeking more detailed information, check out the [JESPR wiki](https://github.com/fildpauz/jespr/wiki) here in GitHub. If you want to start making your own JESPR experiments, download the [jespr-quickstart.zip](https://fildpauz.github.io/jespr/jespr-quickstart.zip) file and see the `README.txt` file therein.
